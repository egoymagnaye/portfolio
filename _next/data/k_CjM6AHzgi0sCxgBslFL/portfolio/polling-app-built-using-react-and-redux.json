So our goal is to build something that can help them decide by letting each staff vote.</span></p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How I built the application?</span></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I developed this polling app using React JS by using the create-react-app package. I used the React Router for page routing. Although it looks like a simple application, I still need a good state management package to help me manage the application state. I used the Redux state management package for this. I love using the Redux dev tools, it gives me a good insight into my app&#8217;s process and state.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The client is currently using WordPress for their business. So I just need to integrate the custom app into their current platform. Luckily, WordPress support REST API so I used that for the application data. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I think planning your CSS is still important when it comes to developing your applications and websites. Other than creating custom CSS for some projects, I&#8217;m using the Bootstrap CSS framework if I&#8217;m building custom websites. But since the Tailwind CSS is becoming popular, I used it for this project.</span></p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature overview:</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Polling capability</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Limited time for polling</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sorted results</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Restricted actions for specific user roles</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Authentication</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mobile-ready</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How does the application work?</span></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I designed the application to make it easier to use. I&#8217;m always assuming that users that will use the application are not tech-savvy. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Before the staff can join the poll, a user with an administrator role needs to add a poll, he/she can add duration and a title for the current poll. </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cms.egoymagnaye.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/adding-of-poll.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A user with no administrator role can only join a poll or view the poll&#8217;s results.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cms.egoymagnaye.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/non-admin.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After an administrator adds a poll, this poll is now listed on the Poll&#8217;s main menu.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cms.egoymagnaye.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/poll-menu.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Then the users or the selected staff can now start voting for their preferred cakes in the single poll menu. They can vote for a limited amount of time only. If the time expires, clicking on the heart button and form submission will be disabled. </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cms.egoymagnaye.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-poll-page.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Also, there&#8217;s a maximum number of cakes that they can select.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cms.egoymagnaye.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/limited-cakes.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The users can view the results by going to the Results page.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cms.egoymagnaye.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sample-results.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Limitations:</span></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some of the administrator actions like adding users and adding cakes are still dependent on WordPress. If the admin needs to add a cake, they need to go to the WP admin to add it. Same for the users, adding new staff need to be performed in the WP admin.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">No in-app user registration functionality.</span></li>\n</ul>\n","techStacks":"React JS, React Router, Redux, WP REST API, Tailwind CSS","excerpt":"Originally developed for a bakery business located in Germany.
